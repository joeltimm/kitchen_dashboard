üöÄ Next on the list: Frontend UI ‚Äî Drag-Resizable Calendar Widget

Now that the backend is set up and your Flask app is running on port 5050, the next step is to work on the frontend UI where the user can:

    See the calendar, local weather, and photos.

    Resize and drag widgets (calendar widget, weather display, etc.).

    Adjust widget order (front/back stacking).

üõ†Ô∏è Next Step: Frontend Setup

Here‚Äôs a high-level breakdown of what we need to do for the frontend:

    Basic Layout:

        Set up a simple HTML structure with div elements for each widget.

        Use CSS Grid or Flexbox to position widgets.

    Drag & Resize Widgets:

        Implement widget interactivity using JavaScript and a library like GridStack.js (for grid-based drag-and-resize).

    Dynamic Data:

        Fetch data for the calendar, weather, and OneDrive images from your backend using AJAX calls to Flask‚Äôs REST endpoints (/api/calendar, /api/weather, /api/photos).

    Save Layout:

        Allow users to adjust the layout (size, position) of widgets.

        Use localStorage or save layout preferences in the backend database.

Step-by-Step for the Frontend:

    Create HTML structure for the dashboard.

    Implement JavaScript for dynamic loading, widget resizing, and drag functionality (using GridStack.js or Interact.js).

    Link backend APIs to dynamically update widgets with data (e.g., calendar events, weather info).

    Optionally, store widget positions and other settings in a JSON file or database for persistence.

Would you like me to:

    Set up the basic HTML template for the dashboard and show how to integrate the backend data?

    Focus on drag-and-drop/resize functionality (with JavaScript and GridStack)?

    Discuss the backend endpoints for weather, calendar, and OneDrive images?

Let me know how you‚Äôd like to proceed!
