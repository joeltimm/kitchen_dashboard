# Kitchen Dashboard Project - To-Do List and Guidance (5.25.25)

This document outlines the updated to-do list and guidance for the kitchen dashboard project, incorporating the change in the credential path to `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth` and the initial development environment being a Linux server before moving to a Raspberry Pi.

## Project Goals and Architecture

*   Create a kitchen dashboard running on a Raspberry Pi eventually.
*   Flask backend for data fetching (Google Calendar, weather, potentially OneDrive).
*   Web-based frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) for display in a fullscreen Chromium browser in kiosk mode.
*   GridStack.js or Interact.js for drag-and-resize widget functionality.
*   Automatic launch on boot and display on/off schedule management (future).
*   Configuration and secrets stored securely in `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth`.

## Key Components Identified

*   **Backend:** `app.py`, `calendar.py`, `calendar_cache.py`, `weather.py`, `photos.py`, `emailer.py`, `config.py`, `scheduler.py`, `utils.py`.
*   **Frontend:** `index.html`, `styles.css`, `dashboard.js`.
*   **Data Storage:** `layout.json`, `settings.json`.
*   **System Integration:** `autostart.desktop`, `run_on_boot.sh`, systemd service files (future).
*   **Setup:** `requirements.txt`, `setup.sh`, `.gitignore`, `.env`, README.md.
*   **Secrets:** Stored in `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth`.

## To-Do List and Guidance

Here's a potential to-do list to guide your development on the Linux server:

1.  **Complete Initial Setup Script (`setup.sh`):**
    *   **Task:** Create or refine the `setup.sh` script to set up the development environment on your Linux server.
    *   **Details:** This script should:
        *   Set up the Python virtual environment.
        *   Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
        *   Ensure the `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth` directory exists.
        *   Provide clear instructions (e.g., in the README or as script output) on where the credential files should be placed within `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth`. **Do not** include sensitive information or attempt to copy credential files in the script itself.
    *   **Guidance:** Make the script idempotent. Consider using environment variables loaded from `config.env` for configuration, which aligns well with future Dockerization.

2.  **Develop Backend API Endpoints:**
    *   **Task:** Implement the Flask backend and define the REST API endpoints (`/api/calendar`, `/api/weather`, `/api/photos`, `/api/settings`, etc.).
    *   **Details:** Focus on the core logic for each endpoint to receive requests and prepare data.
    *   **Guidance:** Start with the calendar endpoint. Implement basic request handling and response formatting. Ensure your backend code correctly looks for credential files in `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth`.

3.  **Implement Data Fetching and Caching:**
    *   **Task:** Write the logic within the backend to fetch data from external sources (Google Calendar API, weather APIs, etc.) and implement a caching mechanism.
    *   **Details:** Use appropriate libraries for interacting with APIs (e.g., `google-api-python-client`). Design the caching strategy to minimize API calls and improve performance.
    *   **Guidance:** Consider using a background task runner or a library like APScheduler within your Flask app to periodically update the cached data.

4.  **Build Frontend Widgets:**
    *   **Task:** Develop the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the individual dashboard widgets (e.g., calendar display, weather widget, photo viewer).
    *   **Details:** Create modular components for each widget. Design the UI and integrate the chosen drag-and-resize library (GridStack.js or Interact.js).
    *   **Guidance:** Focus on making the widgets visually appealing and functional. Ensure they can fetch data from your backend API endpoints.

5.  **Implement Settings UI and Persistence:**
    *   **Task:** Create the frontend UI for configuring user settings (calendar view options, timezone, etc.) and implement the logic to save and load these settings.
    *   **Details:** Design a user-friendly settings interface. Implement AJAX requests from the frontend to the backend to save settings to and load settings from `settings.json`.
    *   **Guidance:** Validate user input on the backend before saving settings.

6.  **Integrate Widget Layout Persistence:**
    *   **Task:** Implement the functionality to save and load the widget layout (positions, sizes, z-order) using the drag-and-resize library.
    *   **Details:** Use the library's API to get the current layout state. Implement backend endpoints to receive the layout data from the frontend and save it to `layout.json`, and to send the saved layout to the frontend on page load.
    *   **Guidance:** Handle potential errors during saving and loading the layout data.

7.  **Set up Development Server Launch:**
    *   **Task:** Create a simple script or command to easily run your Flask development server on your Linux machine.
    *   **Details:** This will allow you to test your backend and frontend locally.
    *   **Guidance:** You can use `flask run` or a similar command. Consider using a tool like `foreman` or `honcho` if you need to run multiple processes (e.g., backend and a frontend build process) concurrently during development.

8.  **Implement Email Notifications:**
    *   **Task:** Develop the `emailer.py` component to send daily summary emails.
    *   **Details:** Use Python's `smtplib` and `email` modules or a third-party library to send emails via Gmail. Ensure secure handling of Gmail credentials from `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth`.
    *   **Guidance:** Implement error handling for email sending failures.

9.  **Prepare for Dockerization (Ongoing Consideration):**
    *   **Task:** As you develop, keep in mind the eventual goal of containerizing the application with Docker.
    *   **Details:** Design your application to be stateless where possible and configurable via environment variables. Avoid hardcoding paths.
    *   **Guidance:** You might consider starting to create a basic `Dockerfile` early on to identify any potential issues with containerizing your application.

10. **Refine and Test:**
    *   **Task:** Continuously refine your code, write tests for individual components, and perform end-to-end testing.
    *   **Details:** Use testing frameworks (e.g., `unittest` or `pytest` for Python, Jest or similar for JavaScript).
    *   **Guidance:** Automate your tests as much as possible.

## Advice

*   **Iterate:** Work on one feature or task at a time. Don't try to build everything at once.
*   **Version Control:** Use Git and commit your changes frequently with clear messages.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement comprehensive error handling and use the `logs/error.log` file to record issues.
*   **Security:** Prioritize secure handling of credentials and API keys. The `kitchen_dashboard/common/auth` structure is a good step, but ensure these files are not included in your version control and have appropriate file permissions.
*   **Testing:** Write tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of your code.
*   **Documentation:** Keep your code and project well-documented. Update the README.md with setup instructions and project details.
*   **Leverage Libraries:** Don't reinvent the wheel. Utilize existing Python and JavaScript libraries to simplify development.

This updated plan should help you organize your development efforts on the Linux server while keeping the final deployment on the Raspberry Pi and future Dockerization in mind.
